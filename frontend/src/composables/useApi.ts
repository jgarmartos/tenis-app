/**
 * Composable wrapper for the new service architecture
 * Provides a clean API for components to use services
 */

// Re-export everything from services for easy access
export * from '@/services';

// You can also create specific composables here if needed
// For example, a composable that combines multiple services:

/*
export function useMatchManagement() {
  // Combine match and place services for complex operations
  return {
    // ... complex logic here
  }
}
*/
